# Phase 2 Code Challenge

## Description

This is a React app created for the Phase 2 Code Challenge. The app fetches posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and displays them in a list format. Each post shows a title and body, and users can interact with the posts through a "Like" button.

## Features

- **Fetch Data**: The app fetches a list of posts from the placeholder API and displays them.
- **State Management**: Uses React state to manage and display the posts.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling for failed API requests.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while the data is being fetched.
- **Like Button (Optional Enhancement)**: Each post has a like button that tracks likes for that post.

## Installation
